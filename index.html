  <h2>Berlin, Day 1</h2>
  <p>He says: "Breathe in and smile. Breathe out and let go all you don't need... <br>
    Breathe in and smile. Breathe out and let it go." <br> I breathe in and I smile. I breathe out and I keep smiling.

While I do enjoy the path to discovery, I also like to take notes; write down my thoughts to witness the change and in the meantime play with html, css and all those other things connected to the web and beyond. <br>
